# Predicting-housing-prices

Using a Linear Regression model to predict the housing prices.

The data was already a clean one so i did not have to clean the data.

I created dummies for the categorical data and a binary function to map the data present as 'Yes' and 'No'.

I visualised the data to see for the correlation among the variables and then did a scaling on the data.

I created a model by adding all the variables and then eliminating them one by one on the basis of their p-values and their VIF's.

I did the residual analysis to check if the residuals are normally distributed.

I did the prediction on the test set using our model.

I also created a model using RFE.
